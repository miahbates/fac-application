## Structure
The site is a simple, one-page design which shows my current skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The site displays my personal and professional experiences, as well as my future career aspirations within software development.

- :orange_heart: CSS grid 
- :yellow_heart: CSS variables
- :green_heart: Flex
- :blue_heart: JS image carousel

## Improvements and futures ideas
- Generate a random colour picker (inspired by [coolers](https://coolors.co/6c464f-9e768f-9fa4c4-b3cdd1-c7f0bd)) to allow endless themes. It would also have been pretty cool for clients to save their favourite colour schemes or customise their own.
- More focus around accessibility. During the my time on this project I was not aware of the lighthouse report which can be generated. Although, I considered accessibility in terms screen size and adding alt tags to images, the lighthouse report retrospectively highlighted remove for improvement. There are few images with missing alt tags, and the links require description to be more accessible to screen readers - I have considered this to be an important learning point for future projects.
